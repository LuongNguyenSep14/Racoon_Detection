# Racoon_Detection
In this project I have used pre-trained model (from [Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md)) is [SSD MobileNet v2 320x320](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/ssd_mobilenet_v2_320x320_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz) and use [dataset](https://github.com/datitran/raccoon_dataset) from repo of [datitran](https://github.com/datitran).<br>

Beside, I have use Object Detection API from Tensorflow, this API help me a lot in Visualizing the Result.
